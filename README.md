## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Designed for iOS 16+ and SwiftUI, this package offers a sleek toast alert for your users. 
With a user-friendly API and complete design customization, 
you have full control over the alert's look and feel.

This is a preview of the first api `interactiveToastAlert`:

The second api `toastAlert` preview:

I am open for suggestions so please if you have any 
new features ideas or bugs create a new issue and let's improve it together üí™üèª.

## How to use <a name="section-1"></a>
To make the api easy as possible I created it using viewModifiers. I created two types of api the first one is the 
`toastAlert` which represent an icon image you choose with a rounded rectangle background and dismiss after 3 seconds,
like this one:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cb3ec3f-aa10-4a5f-b3b2-76773443900a

The second api which is the `interactiveToastAlert` it also does the same thing as `toastAlert` but if the user 
tapped it, it will expand to display more info about the error or what ever message you want to tell to the user and 
after tapping it again it will shrenk and dismiss, Like this one:

### toastAlert <a name="sub-topic-1.1"></a>
To use the `toastAlert` is fairly simple, it takes `isPresented` as flag that tells when to appear and disappear the toast,
`position` which is a type of `AlertPosition` that represents the position of the alert toast, `background`
represent the background view of the toast takes what ever the `foregroundStyle` takes which is a type of `ShapeStyle`,
`alertIconAppearance` which is type of a closure that returns `AlertIconApperance` that represent the icon that will be displayed in the alert and
it's appearance. For example:

```swift
struct SwiftUIView: View {
  @State private var isPresented: Bool = false
  
  var body: some View {
    ZStack {
      Color.white.ignoresSafeArea()
      Button("Hello, World üåç") {
        isPresented.toggle()
      }.foregroundStyle(.black)
    }
    .toastAlert(
      isPresented: $isPresented,
      position: .top,
      background: .black) {
        AlertIconAppearance(image: Image(systemName: "checkmark"), color: .green, font: .system(size: 16, weight: .bold))
      }
 }
}
```
Output:

> [!Warning]  
> Don't change the `isPresented` parameter to false after making it true,
> the api changes the value by it's self and making this change by your self
> may lead to unexpected behaviour.

### interactiveToastAlert <a name="sub-topic-1.2"></a>
This api takes the same parameters as the `toastAlert` but with one more extra parameter which is `alertTextAppearance`,
`alertTextAppearance` is a closure that return `AlertTextAppearance` instance that contains the displaied text and it's
apperance. For example:

```swift
struct SwiftUIView: View {
  @State private var isPresented: Bool = false
  
  var body: some View {
    ZStack {
      Color.white.ignoresSafeArea()
      Button("Hello, World üåç") {
        isPresented.toggle()
      }.foregroundStyle(.black)
    }
    .interactiveToastAlert(isPresented: $isPresented, position: .topTrailing, background: .black) {
      AlertTextAppearance(text: "Replace `var` with `let`", color: .white, font: .system(size: 16, weight: .bold))
    } alertIconAppearance: {
      AlertIconAppearance(image: Image(systemName: "checkmark"), color: .green, font: .system(size: 16, weight: .bold))
    }
 }
}
```

Output:

> [!Note]  
> Don't increase the text that will be displayed in the alert
> more than 2 lines because other wise it will be displayed as
> ...

`color: Color?` represent the color of the icon in the alert, it is used for customizing SF symbol apperance, 
`font: Font?` is used to customize the size and weight of the icon if it was SF symbol.

```swift
/// This type represent the icon that will be displayed in the alert and it's appearance.
public struct AlertIconAppearance {
  /// This represent the icon that will be displayed in the alert, it can be SF symbol or image from the asset catalog.
  public let image: Image

  public init(image: Image, color: Color? = nil, font: Font? = nil) {
    self.image = image
